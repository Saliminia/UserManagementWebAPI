Improvements Explained:
1. Validation for User Input Fields:
Added [Required] and [EmailAddress] data annotations to the User class to ensure that the Name field is required and the Email field is a valid email address.
Added validation checks in the CreateUser and UpdateUser methods to return a BadRequest response if the input data is invalid.

2. Error Handling for Failed Database Lookups:
Added try-catch blocks in all methods to handle unhandled exceptions and return a 500 Internal Server Error status code with the error message.

3. Performance Optimization for GET /users Endpoint:
Implemented pagination in the GetUsers method by accepting pageNumber and pageSize query parameters and using Skip and Take to limit the number of users returned in each request.
